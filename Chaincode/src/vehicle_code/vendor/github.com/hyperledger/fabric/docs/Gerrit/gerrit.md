# Working with Gerrit

Follow these instructions to collaborate on the Hyperledger Fabric Project
through the Gerrit review system.

Please be sure that you are subscribed to the [mailing
list](http://lists.hyperledger.org/mailman/listinfo/hyperledger-fabric) and of
course, you can reach out on [Slack](https://hyperledgerproject.slack.com/) if
you need help.

Gerrit assigns the following roles to users:

* **Submitters**: May submit changes for consideration, review other code
  changes, and make recommendations for acceptance or rejection by voting
  +1 or -1, respectively.
* **Maintainers**: May approve or reject changes based upon feedback from
  reviewers voting +2 or -2, respectively.
* **Builders**: (e.g. Jenkins) May use the build automation infrastructure to
  verify the change.

Maintainers should be familiar with the [review process](reviewing.md). However,
anyone is welcome to (and encouraged!) review changes, and hence may find that
document of value.

## Git-review

There's a **very** useful tool for working with Gerrit called
[git-review](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Gerrit/git-review). This
command-line tool can automate most of the ensuing sections for you. Of course,
reading the information below is also highly recommended so that you understand
what's going on behind the scenes.

## Sandbox project

We have created a [sandbox
project](https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/admin/projects/lf-sandbox) to allow
developers to familiarize themselves with Gerrit and our workflows. Please do
feel free to use this project to experiment with the commands and tools, below.

## Getting deeper into Gerrit

A comprehensive walk-through of Gerrit is beyond the scope of this document.
There are plenty of resources available on the Internet. A good summary can be
found [here](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Gerrit/Tutorial). We have also
provided a set of [Best Practices](best-practices.md) that you may find helpful.

## Working with a local clone of the repository

To work on something, whether a new feature or a bugfix:

1. Open the Gerrit [Projects page](https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/admin/projects/)

2. Select the project you wish to work on.

3. Open a terminal window and clone the project locally using the `Clone with git
hook` URL. Be sure that `ssh` is also selected, as this will make authentication
much simpler:
```
git clone ssh://LFID@gerrit.hyperledger.org:29418/fabric && scp -p -P 29418 LFID@gerrit.hyperledger.org:hooks/commit-msg fabric/.git/hooks/
```

**Note:** if you are cloning the fabric project repository, you will want to
clone it to the `$GOPATH/src/github.com/hyperledger` directory so that it will
build, and so that you can use it with the Vagrant [development
environment](../dev-setup/devenv.md).

4. Create a descriptively-named branch off of your cloned repository

```
cd fabric
git checkout -b issue-nnnn
```

5. Commit your code. For an in-depth discussion of creating an effective commit,
please read [this document](changes.md).

```
git commit -s -a
```

Then input precise and readable commit msg and submit.

6. Any code changes that affect documentation should be accompanied by
corresponding changes (or additions) to the documentation and tests. This
will ensure that if the merged PR is reversed, all traces of the change will
be reversed as well.

## Submitting a Change

Currently, Gerrit is the only method to submit a change for review. **Please review
the [guidelines](changes.md) for making and submitting a change**.

### Use git review

**Note:** if you prefer, you can use the [git-review](#git-review) tool instead
of the following. e.g.

Add the following section to `.git/config`, and replace `<USERNAME>` with your 
gerrit id.

```
[remote "gerrit"]
    url = ssh://<USERNAME>@gerrit.hyperledger.org:29418/fabric.git
    fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/gerrit/*
```

Then submit your change with `git review`.

```
$ cd <your code dir>
$ git review
```

When you update your patch, you can commit with `git commit --amend`, and then 
repeat the `git review` command.

### Not Use git review

Directions for building the source code can be found [here](../dev-setup/build.md).

When a change is ready for submission, Gerrit requires that the
change be pushed to a special branch. The name of this special branch
contains a reference to the final branch where the code should reside,
once accepted.

For the Hyperledger Fabric Project, the special branch is called `refs/for/master`.

To push the current local development branch to the gerrit server, open a
terminal window at the root of your cloned repository:

```
cd <your clone dir>
git push origin HEAD:refs/for/master
```
If the command executes correctly, the output should look similar to this:

```
Counting objects: 3, done.
Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 306 bytes | 0 bytes/s, done.
Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
remote: Processing changes: new: 1, refs: 1, done
remote:
remote: New Changes:
remote:   https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/6 Test commit
remote:
To ssh://LFID@gerrit.hyperledger.org:29418/fabric
* [new branch]      HEAD -> refs/for/master
```

The gerrit server generates a link where the change can be tracked.

## Adding reviewers

Optionally, you can add reviewers to your change.

To specify a list of reviewers via the command line, add
`%r=reviewer@project.org` to your push command. For example:

```
git push origin HEAD:refs/for/master%r=rev1@email.com,r=rev2@notemail.com
```
   Alternatively, you can auto-configure GIT to add a set of reviewers if your
   commits will have the same reviewers all at the time.

   To add a list of default reviewers, open the :file:`.git/config` file in the
   project directory and add the following line in the `[ branch “master” ]`
   section:

```
[branch "master"] #.... push =
HEAD:refs/for/master%r=rev1@email.com,r=rev2@notemail.com`
```

Make sure to use actual email addresses instead of the `@email.com and @notemail.com`
addressses. Don't forget to replace `origin` with your git remote name.

## Reviewing Using Gerrit

* **Add**: This button allows the change submitter to manually add names of
  people who should review a change; start typing a name and the system
  will auto-complete based on the list of people registered and with
  access to the system. They will be notified by email that you are
  requesting their input.

* **Abandon**: This button is available to the submitter only; it allows a
  committer to abandon a change and remove it from the merge queue.

* **Change-ID**: This ID is generated by Gerrit (or system). It becomes
  useful when the review process determines that your commit(s) have to
  be amended. You may submit a new version; and if the same Change-ID
  header (and value) are present, Gerrit will remember it and present
  it as another version of the same change.

* **Status**: Currently, the example change is in review status, as indicated
  by “Needs Verified” in the upper-left corner. The list of
  Reviewers will all emit their opinion, voting +1 if they agree to the
  merge, -1 if they disagree. Gerrit users with a Maintainer role can
  agree to the merge or refuse it by voting +2 or -2 respectively.

Notifications are sent to the email address in your commit message's
Signed-off-by line. Visit your [Gerrit dashboard](https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/dashboard/self), to check the progress of your requests.

The history tab in Gerrit will show you the in-line comments and the author of
the review.

## Viewing Pending Changes

Find all pending changes by clicking on the `All --> Changes` link in the
upper-left corner, or [open this link](https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/q/project:fabric).

If you collaborate in multiple projects, you may wish to limit searching to
the specific branch through the search bar in the upper-right side.

Add the filter *project:fabric* to limit the visible changes to
only those from the Hyperledger Fabric Project.

List all current changes you submitted, or list just those changes in need
of your input by clicking on `My --> Changes` or [open this link](https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/dashboard/self)
