# Setting up the Full Hyperledger fabric Developer's Environment

 * See [Setting Up The Development Environment](../dev-setup/devenv.md) to set up your development environment.
 
 * The following commands are all issued from the vagrant environment. The following will open a terminal session:

```
   cd <your cloned location>/fabric/devenv
   vagrant up
   vagrant ssh
```

 * Issue the following commands to build the Hyperledger fabric client (HFC) Node.js SDK including the API reference documentation

```
   cd /opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/sdk/node
   make all
```
 * Issue the following command where your Node.js application is located if you wish to use the `require("hfc")`, this will install the HFC locally.

```
  npm install /opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/sdk/node
```

   Or point to the HFC directly by using the following `require()` in your code:

```javascript
   require("/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/sdk/node");
```

 * To build the API reference documentation:

```
   cd /opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/sdk/node
   make doc
```  

 * To build the reference documentation in the [Self Contained Node.js Environment](node-sdk-self-contained.md):

```
   docker exec -it nodesdk /bin/bash
   cd /opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/sdk/node
   make doc
```

 * The the API reference documentation will be available in:
 ```
   /opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/sdk/node/doc
 ```
