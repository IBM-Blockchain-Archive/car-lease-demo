# Hyperledger fabric Client (HFC) SDK for Node.js 

The Hyperledger fabric Client (HFC) SDK for Node.js provides a powerful and easy to use API to interact with a Hyperledger fabric blockchain. The HFC is designed to be used in the Node.js JavaScript runtime.

#### Overview and Deep Dive

* [Application Developer's Overview](app-overview.md) for a topological overview of applications and a blockchain.

* [Hyperledger fabric Client (HFC) SDK for Node.js](node-sdk-indepth.md) the Node.js client SDK in more depth

#### Development Environment Choices

* *Recommended:* [Self Contained Node.js Environment](node-sdk-self-contained.md) uses pre-built docker images for the Node.js client application interacting with Hyperledger fabric blockchain. This environment may suffice for a majority of Node.js application developers. The environment contains a built-in standalone sample ready to go.

* [Full Hyperledger fabric development environment](app-developer-env-setup.md) on how to set up an environment for developing chaincode and applications.
  
  **Note:** Only recommended for development of the Hyperledger fabric Client SDK itself.


#### Sample Code

* [Node.js Standalone Application in Vagrant](sample-standalone-app.md) for a sample standalone Node.js application running in the full development environment within Vagrant.

* [Node.js Web Application](sample-web-app.md) for a sample web application and to see how to use the Node.js client SDK for a sample web app leveraging the client SDK to interact with a blockchain network.
