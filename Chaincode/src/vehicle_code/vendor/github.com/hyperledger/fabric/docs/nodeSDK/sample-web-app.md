# Node.js Web Application

The following is a web application template.  It is NOT a complete program.

This template code demonstrates how to communicate with a blockchain from a Node.js web application.  It does not show how to listen for incoming requests nor how to authenticate your web users as this is application specific.  The code below is intended to demonstrate how to interact with a Hyperledger fabric blockchain from an existing web application.

You may retrieve the [sample application]( https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hyperledger/fabric/master/examples/sdk/node/web-app.js) file:

```
  curl -o app.js https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hyperledger/fabric/master/examples/sdk/node/web-app.js
